  <h4>Feedback from Jeseekia and David</h4>
<p>You’re off to a good start so far on the portfolio site. You should continue to work on this and make it better as you learn more. A good place to start is rearranging your project so that all of the pages for the site are in one folder rather than keeping each of them separate. You can also revisit your home page HTML and clean up the tags that are out of place (line 3, line 19, line 20, line 37). From there, think about adding a consistent navigation to all of the HTML pages so that no matter what page you’re on, you can always get to either of the other pages. Definitely take the time to revisit and complete the JavaScript component as well. Looking forward to seeing your portfolio progress!</p>
